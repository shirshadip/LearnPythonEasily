                        Python is a interpreted Language,It converts the Language to a Low Level Language Line by Line

            <div class="blog" id="interpreter">
                <li>
                    An interpreter is a type of program that executes source code directly, one instruction at a time,
                    instead of translating the entire program into machine code before execution.

                </li>
                <li>
                    some interpreted languages ----------> Python,Javascript,Shell
                </li>
                <br>
                <br>
                <p style="color: rebeccapurple;">
                    the difference in compiler and interpreter is that,
                    compiler converts the High Level program to a machine Level code (Assembly Language).
                    But for Assembly Language there is assembler which converts machine code to binary Language.

                    <br>
                    A interpreter converts the source code to low level program line by line then i will convert into
                    machine code
